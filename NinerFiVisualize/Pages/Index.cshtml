        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            NinerFi Analytics is a student led project focussed on creating
            useful visualizations of campus network data.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was created because UNCC has nearly 2 years of network
            data in archives with no easy way to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            This web application provides students and staff with an easy way
            to view various network statistics for research or business purposes.
